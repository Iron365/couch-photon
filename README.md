## FAQ

__Where are source files?__

Photon never existed as source _files_. Its sources are CouchDB _docs_, and it is developed and built using specialized dev environment, [CloudWall](http://cloudwall.me).

__What is underlying technology?__

Photon employs most conservative and bullet-proof approaches whenever possible: jQuery plus established plugins to render UI, and XMLHttpRequest to interact with CouchDB. Photon contains no libs, originating from corporate OSS. 

__Why Photon uses Google fonts?__

Monospaced fonts are downloaded from Google webfonts to avoid inclusion large font attachments in Photon ddoc. One font family adds ~0.5â€“0.8Mb to ddoc size.

__Is it safe to update from CDN?__

Default CDN has logging turned off, so requests and IPs are not collected. Update is always explicit and never performed until you click the update link.
